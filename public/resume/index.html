            I am a software engineer with an active Top Secret clearance at Northrop Grumman Corporation in Linthicum Heights, Maryland.
            For this role, I work mainly with the TCL programming language to control hardware,
            update a graphical user interface and collect accurate data during hardware tests.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am also a technical specialist at the Apple Store in Columbia, Maryland. Here, I diagnose,
            troubleshoot and triage software and hardware issues on various Apple devices that customers bring in.
        </p>

            I hope to get into some neuroscience research and contribute to studies on attention,
            sensory processing and brain wave activity during sleep and other activities. I would love to
            use EEG or CAT scans to look at brain waves.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have been getting into web development and have a strong interest in robotics.
