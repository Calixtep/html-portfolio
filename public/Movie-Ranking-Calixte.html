    <h3><li>The Truman Show</li></h3>
    This is my favorite movie. The psychology behind it is incredible.

    <h3><li>Ex-Machina</li></h3>
    Thought-provoking sci-fi movie. Very worth the watch.

    <h3><li>Inception</li></h3>
    Brain squeeze of a movie. You'll have to watch this one 3 times.

    <h3><li>Shrek</li></h3>
    Hilarious family movie with undoubtedly the world's greatest soundtrack.

    <h3><li>Big Hero 6</li></h3>
    Ingenuitive, emotionally engaging family film.
